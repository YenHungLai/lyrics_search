// Context API
Context API provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
    or
const {Provider, Consumer } = React.createContext(); // I like

Creates a Context object.
When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.

The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree.

Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue.

// Context.Provider
<MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>

Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.

Accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider.
One Provider can be connected to many consumers.

Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree.

All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Providerâ€™s value prop changes.

// Class.contextType
class MyClass extends React.Component {
    this.context
}

MyClass.contextType = MyContext;

The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext().
This lets you consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context.
You can reference this in any of the lifecycle methods including the render function.

// Context.Consumer
<MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer>

A React component that subscribes to context changes.
This lets you subscribe to a context within a function component.
Requires a function as a child.
The function receives the current context value and returns a React node.
The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree.
If there is no Provider for this context above, the value argument will be equal to the defaultValue that was passed to createContext().
